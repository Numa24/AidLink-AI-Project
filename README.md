# 🌍 AidLink – AI-powered NGO & Volunteer Connector

AidLink is a platform that bridges the gap between NGOs who need help and volunteers who want to contribute.  
It uses **AI-powered matching** to connect the right volunteers with the right NGO needs based on skills, interests, and context.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI-based Volunteer Matching** → Recommends volunteers for NGO needs based on description/skills.  
- **REST API Backend** → Built with FastAPI for handling AI integration.  
- **Frontend** → User-friendly interface (to be added).
